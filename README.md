# lixo

Small program to make the background for a "Rubbish Clock" for rubbish days in Lisbon. Lisbon has a [weekly calendar](https://informacoeseservicos.lisboa.pt/servicos/dias-do-lixo) of pick up of paper and cardboard ("papel") in a blue container, plastic and metal ("embalgens") in a yellow container and other waste ("lixo") in a grey container. It varies depending on where you are in the city. This program produces the background for a clock that uses a 7-day mechanism to point to each day and indicate which container needs to be put on the street.

It creates an SVG file and a PDF. Just run `make`.
